# Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using Machine Learning

This project is based on my research work and presentation on Human Activity Recognition (HAR), where I developed and evaluated machine learning models to classify human activities from sensor data. It includes preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation using real-world or simulated datasets.

## üìù Abstract
Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a crucial task in wearable computing and healthcare monitoring. In this project, we explore the use of [e.g., deep learning models like LSTM] on [accelerometer and gyroscope] data to recognize physical activities such as walking, sitting, standing, and jogging. Our model achieves high accuracy and generalizes well across different subjects.
